            <p>Business runs on information. The faster itâ€™s received and the more <br>accurate it is, the better. Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information because it provides immediate,<br> shared and completely transparent information stored on an immutable ledger that can be accessed only by <br>permissioned network members. A blockchain network can track orders, payments, <br>accounts, production and much more. And because members share a single view of <br>the truth, you can see all details of a transaction end to end, giving you <br>greater confidence, as well as new efficiencies and opportunities.</p>
